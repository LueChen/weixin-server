# weixin-server

```
  This is a weixin server for my weixin public service to do sms forward from my CMCC phone to my Unicom phone.
```

  Work with the Android App which my CMCC Sim card is in.
  
  The Android App code is [here](https://github.com/LueChen/Clean-SmS-Forwarding). Forked from: [https://github.com/autosquid](https://github.com/autosquid), Many thanks to him.
